For the research phase, Andrew created and shared a survey asking people questions about their eating habits as well as about how they socialized while eating. He also conducted direct observation by going to UCSD’s Price Center and taking recordings of students, staff, and faculty and the ways they engaged with one another over meals if at all. During the prototyping session, Andrew was responsible for organizing the prototyping session and played a role in automating some of the spreadsheets as well as providing the snacks for the eating portion of the session. After the prototyping session, he created some of the initial Figma mockups for the prototype shown in the presentation and on this site as well as some of the iterated mockup pages. He also documented the prototyping process for both the final presentation as well as for this stage.

David provided his own research through interviews and contextual inquiries. A majority of the time, he was to provide support while learning the ups and downs of how to use front end software like Figma. For the initial prototype, he created the pre-questionnaire that was to be used to sort the users during the prototyping session and created an excel sheet to total up the “Creators” and “Joiners” scores. Additionally, he was tasked with creating logos for “Munchmates” through Figma and created multiple iterations ranging from abstract, pictorial, and word marks.

Hayden helped with some of the initial ideations and provided a literature review and interview when conducting research. Additionally he helped provide ideas for the initial and final prototypes, along with doing some basic project management during the feedback evaluation and final prototype generation phase. Finally he helped write the document script used for the portfolio production, in addition to fleshing out the pitch, prototype, and final presentation slides.

Kirubel contributed by gathering user research through user interviews. Prior to the prototype session, he created relevant tags for each group spreadsheet. He also assisted in the post-prototype feature ideation session and constructed low fidelity wireframes to be used as assets for the portfolio landing page.

<ProjectCard title="Luke" link="" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
Luke spearheaded the development of a web backend for our prototype. While the backend did not see the light of day during the presentation, we hope to use it for future iterations on the project beyond this class. He helped assist in the re-conceptualization of the project after the waves of feedback came in.  Post-prototype-phase, he handled the creation of the portfolio site, managed hosting, and dealt with domain providers to get our portfolio site online. This site you’re reading right now is coded by him, and is available on Github.
