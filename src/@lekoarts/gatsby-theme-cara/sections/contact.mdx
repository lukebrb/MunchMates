# What We Learned
Throughout the MunchMates creation process our team has learned several valuable lessons about both the world of social eating experiences, in addition to project creation. The first and most obvious lesson was how important social experiences are, as shown through both our academic research, and personal data collection. Using this as a pillar for our project highlighted a shared love of culinary experiences amongst many people. In terms of project development, learning to set timelines and pivot when needed become a critical aspect of our development cycle, as we decided after our first prototype to switch our demographic and narrow our focus. Through feedback, we learned that social eating experiences can be hard to foster organically, and that most people need an additional incentive before joining something similar to what our app offers. Additionally, we learned that not everyone is looking to make new connections, but those who are often are nervous about taking the first steps to seek out others, an avenue on which our platform would ideally thrive on. Food is something that creates a bonding experience between two individuals, and providing a route for those seeking social connections, and a shared eating experience can help create new relationships that many often desperately need. 

# Final Remarks
While the MunchMates app primarily focuses on eating experiences, we
        hope that with the right growth, the app could expand to include other
        group activities in order to expand the number and type of connections
        individuals using the app could make. While one of our biggest barriers
        to entry are the social obligations that come along with eating out
        socially, the incentives we added, along with the added focus on
        demographics that do not get as many social opportunities would ideally
        increase our user base which would then lead to promotion by word of
        mouth. We hope to expand and improve MunchMates so that it can continue
        to foster social connections both at, and away from the dinner table.
