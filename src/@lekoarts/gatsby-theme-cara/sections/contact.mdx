# Final Remarks
While the MunchMates app primarily focuses on eating experiences, we
        hope that with the right growth, the app could expand to include other
        group activities in order to expand the number and type of connections
        individuals using the app could make. While one of our biggest barriers
        to entry are the social obligations that come along with eating out
        socially, the incentives we added, along with the added focus on
        demographics that do not get as many social opportunities would ideally
        increase our user base which would then lead to promotion by word of
        mouth. We hope to expand and improve MunchMates so that it can continue
        to foster social connections both at, and away from the dinner table.
