# The Social Setting
Within the UCSD campus, we noticed that a large number of students ate by themselves while taking up entire tables meant to seat 4 or more people. While eating, students do not socialize with anyone unless they see a passerby they are familiar with. However, a majority of the time these students tend to eat in isolation. They eat quietly to themselves while studying for their classes or scrolling through their mobile phones. We realized that these students must have their own reasons for eating alone whether it be because they are in a hurry, they couldn’t find someone to dine with, or they simply didn’t feel like socializing. However, there does exist a demographic that wants to share meals with others, but does not have an avenue through which to create connections that would allow for shared meal experiences, creating an isolating feeling that deserved a solution.

## Motivation
While eating alone is something that everyone has experienced at least once in their lives, we believe that creating social eating experiences around dining tables can help foster positive interactions with others, and even promote better mental health and well-being. This leads us to asking how we can get individuals involved in an experience where they might not know anyone else participating, and how we can promote the formation of connection between those users? The answer and motivation behind our application is that food is an experience everyone enjoys sharing, and being both disarming and satisfying, is something almost anyone could bond over. Therefore, the creation of an application that functions as a meal meetup platform for creating group eating experiences, could help solve the isolating effects of solitary eating or at the very least provide people who don’t eat alone by choice a viable alternative.
